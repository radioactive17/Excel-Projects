## Coffee Orders Dashboard

Developed an Excel dashboard to analyze coffee sales data across different dimensions such as roast type, size, and customer loyalty. The dashboard includes interactive filters for order dates, roast types, and other key metrics. I utilized various Excel functions such as XLOOKUP, SUMIF, and INDEX-MATCH to dynamically process and visualize the data. Additionally, I employed Pivot Tables and Slicers to create an intuitive user interface that provides insights into total sales over time, sales by country, and top customers. This tool allows stakeholders to easily identify sales trends, regional performance, and customer preferences, making it a valuable resource for decision-making in the coffee industry.

## Bike Sales Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard analyzing bike sales data across various demographics and regions. The dashboard allows users to filter data based on marital status, education level, regions, and the number of children. Key insights include average income per purchase segmented by gender, bike purchases across different age groups, and customer commute distances. The dashboard provides a clear visual representation of how different factors influence bike sales, offering valuable information for business decision-making.
